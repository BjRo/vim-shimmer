# Deprecated
This plugin is deprecated. [vim-test](https://github.com/janko-m/vim-test) offers much more (and is what I personally use nowadays).

# shimmer.vim

I created the `shimmer.vim` plugin out of a personal need. I'm using [vim](http://www.vim.org) for work in multiple languages (Ruby, Elixir, and others). For every language there's a Vim plugin to do all sorts of things, but I want to reuse the same keybindings across language borders. Running tests for instance is one of those things and it's the first thing I implemented.

## How it works
`shimmer.vim` just looks at the current filetype and dispatches to other vim plugins and functions dependend on that. If you're inside a `Ruby` file [rubytest.vim](https://github.com/janx/vim-rubytest) is used for running the tests. If you're inside a `Elixir` file [extest.vim](https://github.com/BjRo/vim-extest) will be used instead.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

```console
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/BjRo/vim-shimmer.git
```
## Key Bindings
The plugin exposes the following commands.

* `:ShimmerTestRunFile` runs all the tests in the file that is loaded into the current buffer
* `:ShimmerTestRunTest` runs the test case under the cursor
* `:ShimmerTestRunLast` runs the last test, from any buffer

If you don't bind them to keys in your `.vimrc` they will default to the following configuration:

```vim
map <leader>T :ShimmerTestRunFile<CR>
map <leader>t :ShimmerTestRunMethod<CR>
map <leader>lt :ShimmerTestRunLast<CR>
```

But of course, you can always override this.
